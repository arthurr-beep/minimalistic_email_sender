## A Minimalistic Email Sending Python Package

This is to make email sending in python easy to use.
You just need to convert your attachments as base64 str using the package 'file_to_base64' function
and send emails using the EmailSender class

## TODO
1. Refine logic and add doc string comments
2. Write sufficient Tests
3. Add another easy to use feature
4. Publish package
